                    I can still remember that once when I was a child, my parents went away together and needed me to
                    solve
                    my lunch by myself. My mother will tell me how to cook a bowl of delicious noodles, how to boil
                    water,
                    how to cook noodles, how to prepare noodles side dishes and so on. Although I have been able to feed
                    myself by cooking in another country after many years, I still can't forget how my mother gave me
                    simple
                    and precise instructions to complete the cooking process according to her introduction. Even now,
                    when
                    cooking, I still need to refer to the recipe and divide "how to make a dish" into the most
                    straightforward basic processes, such as cutting, cooking, stir-frying, etc. Combine these steps in
                    an
                    orderly way to become a dish with colour and flavour.

                    The Daojing, an ancient book in China, once said that "Governing a big country is as delicate as
                    frying
                    a small fish". Although cooking a dish doesn't seem to have anything to do with Computational
                    Thinking.
                    I'm learning to communicate with something to share such things one day to teach them how to cook.
                    After
                    I took these courses, they could understand what I was saying and follow my instructions.â€‹

                    Computational Thinking is a course that teaches us how to communicate with computers, to better
                    express
                    what we want computers to do by learning their way of reflection, and to ensure that computers can
                    execute our instructions according to our wishes. Generally speaking, Computational Thinking
                    consists of
                    four main parts: disassembly, encapsulation, pattern recognition and Algorithm. Each component
                    complements the other and becomes a unique mode of thought, which enables us to model real problems
                    as a
                    workflow that conforms to the working principle of the computer. And guide us in the follow-up
                    operation
                    to transform these processes into executable computer programs.

                    Computational Thinking includes Decomposition, Abstraction, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithm
                    design.
                    Just as we try to divide complex mathematical formulas into simple forms every time, we can break
                    down
                    significant problems into smaller ones through decomposition. We can solve them with some simple
                    operations, principles and conditions. Abstraction helps us to combine small modules into a complete
                    system, enabling us to reuse some parts independently while focusing more on a specific small-scale
                    system at the same time rather than always taking into account the rest of the whole system. Pattern
                    Recognition is by observing the laws of things and abstracting them, just like finding the formula
                    applicable to the problem and using the formula to solve the answer.

                    And Algorithm is to construct a set of steps that can solve problems, and we can follow this series
                    of
                    steps to drive the computer so that it can solve real problems. Computational Thinking provides a
                    set of
                    thought tools that enable us to understand the logic of the computer, thus better control the
                    computer,
                    understand how the computer behaves under one control, and design better control signals.

                    Although Computational Thinking will still make outstanding achievements in subsequent computer
                    science-related courses, it has impacted my life, especially my habit of using computers.

                    For example, I began to pay attention to the accuracy of an operation or feedback. My computer and
                    mobile phone can accurately give feedback on the information I want, especially being able to
                    accurately
                    adjust some parameters. With the resolution of photos produced by my mobile camera, I began to pay
                    attention to the actual resolution of the photo quality rather than rough descriptors such as
                    "extremely
                    high" or "standard".

                    Another change is that after accumulating some knowledge, I began to pay attention to the
                    encapsulation
                    and reuse of the various tools. I began studying the actual paths and commands behind some shortcuts
                    on
                    Windows computers and created shortcuts according to my needs. For example, when I need to start a
                    virtual environment for Python, I can make a shortcut that can quickly call cmd.exe, cd to the
                    folder I
                    need, and run venv's activate script. This dramatically facilitates my efficiency every time I write
                    Python code.

                    Computational Thinking has brought me much more than that, but I have started here and will continue
                    to
                    work hard to keep improving.
