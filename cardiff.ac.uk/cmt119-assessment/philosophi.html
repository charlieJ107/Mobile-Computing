                    The computer is called The Greatest machine that never was. Computer science, the closest discipline
                    to
                    computers, has enriched its connotation and strengthened its energy in hundreds of years of
                    development
                    since the Industrial Revolution. Nowadays, computer science has become an independent, profound and
                    still developing discipline and releases more power in the intersection with other fields.

                    Alan Turing, the founder of computer science, asked, "Can machines think?" It has been quoted so
                    many
                    times that many people confuse it with the question, "Can a machine think like a human". Nowadays,
                    even
                    with the development of computer science for nearly a hundred years, machines are still unable to
                    think
                    like human beings. On the contrary, many people devote themselves to researching how to control the
                    machine better. When we face a variety of problems in research, people have to sum up a series of
                    methodologies that are very useful in problem modelling or the design of operation steps and
                    condense it
                    into a mode of thinking. People find that we can constantly get better results when we master such
                    thinking methods and use these methods to understand computers and make better use of computers.
                    This
                    method is called Computational Thinking. From the meaning of the word philosophy, this is the
                    philosophy
                    of computers.

                    Although Computational Thinking includes Decomposition, Abstraction, Pattern Recognition and
                    Algorithm
                    Design in terms of concepts explained by many materials, from a philosophical point of view, I have
                    found many philosophical viewpoints that are consistent with Computational Thinking. In the next
                    part of
                    the article, I will explain the connotation of Computational Thinking from these philosophical
                    points of
                    view.

            <h2 class="subtitle-h2">Reductionism</h2>
            <div class="article-block">
                <p class="normal">
                    If we go deep into the world of computer science, We will find that most people are reductionists.
                    The
                    Turing machine, which can calculate everything computable, is one of the most typical reductionist
                    machines. People with computational thinking believe a complex system can be modelled precisely and
                    exactly by a few simple principles or a combination and interaction of several subsystems.
                    Conversely,
                    if you cannot break things apart like a reductionist, you may have a miserable life in computer
                    science.
                    An example of this is simply the title image of this passage.

                <p class="normal">
                    For someone who does not have Computational thought, the fact that "the equals sign assigns the
                    value on
                    the right to the left" might be so simple that they may want to move on to the next topic as soon as
                    possible. Such a person may find that people like programmer seems to like to show off some
                    introductory
                    knowledge of some disciplines or extremely bizarre concepts regardless of the occasion. Programmers
                    seem
                    always entangled in some shallow and uninteresting introductory knowledge rather than confronting
                    real
                    problems. They will even get annoyed and say, "We are talking about real issues, and if you do not
                    understand anything, you cannot talk about it". However, to people with Computational Thinking, this
                    introductory knowledge, like the book of Genesis, underlies all the following discussions. They
                    don't
                    like those high-level assertions that have no origin. Instead, they start from the most
                    uncomplicated,
                    primary, and improbable things and construct and derive high-level topics on their initiative.

                    Learning in the field or communicating with a machine smoothly is more manageable if someone
                    understands
                    reductionism. Moreover, there will be fewer bugs in writing code. It may be difficult for such a
                    person
                    to become a qualified practitioner in the computer field and even more challenging to achieve

            <div class="article-block">
                <p class="normal">
                    Suppose reductionism opens the black boxes of problems. In that case, systems theory tries to
                    encapsulate the low-level details into black boxes and make problems easier to solve based on these
                    functions. Computer science is an engineering discipline. Just as it is impossible to disassemble a
                    complete car just by disassembling the parts, it is necessary to start with the most fundamental
                    components, design a suitable structure, and assemble them into a finished product.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="article-block">
                <p class="normal">
                    Any qualified computer science practitioner must have at least some systems thinking. After we use
                    the
                    idea of reductionism to implement more complex operations with the most uncomplicated process, we
                    need
                    to use system theory to combine complex procedures into a complete system. We need to consider what
                    this
                    function needs to pass in, what it will give back, and how much it can guarantee that it will not go
                    wrong. Suppose a practitioner cannot understand these, he may be able to stay on simple introductory
                    programs with only a few lines of code. More than that is required for more complex programs or
                    systems,
                    which are usually complex enough to solve real-world problems. It can be seen that system theory is
                    an
                    essential part of Computational Thinking and one of the critical cornerstones guiding the
                    development of
                    computer science.

                <p class="normal">
                    I intended to use the concept of Control Theory to describe the philosophy used in
                    Computational Thinking to design a series of steps for machines and to understand and abstract
                    existing
                    control processes. However, with further research, cybernetics can only well summarize the
                    ideological
                    connotation of a computer in the parts of Algorithm and Pattern Recognition.

                    Computer science is the science that revolves around the most exquisite machine in human history. To
                    control this machine well, we must guide our process according to a set of theories. As a complex
                    system, if there is a slight difference in the control signal of any part, it will bring severe and
                    complicated consequences. This feature means we must carefully design each control signal and handle
                    every feedback output from the system. Although many scholars have given different definitions of
                    the
                    word algorithm, it always expresses the same meaning to a certain extent. In a broad sense, some
                    specified steps to do some operations to achieve a specific purpose can be regarded as an algorithm.
                    Because computer science revolves around the computer, a loyal, reliable and complex machine, when
                    the
                    algorithm we set, or the operation procedure, is accurate and robust enough, we can ensure that the
                    computer works according to our requirements.

                    For a computer science practitioner, the algorithm is not only a work step to be designed when
                    communicating with the computer but also an abstraction of the solution. Algorithms enable us to be
                    abstract, encapsulate the patterns of a series of simple operational processes into reusable steps,
                    and
                    split the problem into these reusable steps when we encounter more complex problems. It also enables
                    us
                    to organize solutions exquisitely and efficiently and build solutions to new problems using existing
                    knowledge of solutions to other issues. Suppose someone needs to gain the ability and expertise in
                    this
                    area, which means they cannot model a real problem as a problem that can be executed by a computer
                    and
                    then cannot give the computer the correct instructions to solve it. This is unimaginable in the
                    research
                    and work in computer science.

                    Although a simple enumeration of several ideas does not generalize the whole meaning of
                    Computational
                    Thinking, Computational Thinking contains considerable guidance from these philosophical ideas. It
                    refines the specific problems in computer science. Computational thinking is not a simple
                    combination of
                    ideas but the product of complex chemical reactions of many different modes of thinking in one
                    discipline. It is also the internal driving force to constantly improve and enrich itself in the
                    course
                    of nearly a hundred years of development of this discipline. Mastering Computational Thinking and
                    using
                    it to guide the study and work in the field of computer science is necessary for further in-depth
                    study
                    of computer science.
