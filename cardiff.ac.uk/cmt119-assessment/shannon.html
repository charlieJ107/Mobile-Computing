                    Science seeks the basic laws of nature. Mathematics searches for new theorems to build upon the old.
                    Engineering builds systems to solve human needs. The three disciplines are interdependent but
                    distinct. Very rarely does one individual simultaneously make central contributions to all three —
                    but Claude Shannon was a rare individual.

                    Shannon was born in Gaylord, Michigan, in 1916, his parents are a local businessman and a teacher.
                    After earning a double bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and mathematics from the
                    University of Michigan, Shannon entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and began her
                    graduate studies.

                    In his master thesis, he applied the mathematical method of Boolean algebra to the analysis and
                    synthesis of switching circuits in the electronic field. At the time, electromagnetic relays were
                    used to build circuits that routed telephone calls or controlled complex machines. However, The way
                    people thought about them was in terms of the relay coils being energized or not. And there was no
                    consistent theory on how to design or analyze such circuits. Shannon used Boolean algebra of logic
                    to analyze, and then synthesize, switching circuits and to prove that the overall circuit worked as
                    desired. And he invented the AND, OR, and NOT logic gates, upon wich the entire edifice of computer
                    science is based.

                    His most frequently mentioned achievement is information theory, which he calls "grand unified
                    theory for communication" in a letter to his mentor in in 1939. The core of the theory proposed by
                    Shannon is a simple but universal communication model: the transmitter encodes the information into
                    a signal, which is affected by noise and then decoded by the receiver. Although the model is simple,
                    it contains two key elements: the signal source and noise source are separated from the
                    communication system to be designed, and the probabilistic modeling of the two sources is carried
                    out respectively.

                    Shannon creatively applied probability to the measurement of information, transforming the
                    communication problem from a physical problem to a mathematical problem. This is quite different
                    from the previous common method of treating the communication problem as the reconstruction problem
                    of deterministic signals. It is this assumption that allows Shannon to use probability to model
                    uncertainty.
                    And uncertainty is the charm of communication.

                    Shannon gave a formula for the minimum number of bits per second to represent the information, a
                    number he called its entropy rate, <span class="formular">H</span> Then he provide a formula for the
                    maximum number of bits per
                    second that can be reliably communicated in the face of noise, which he called the system’s
                    capacity, <span class="formular">C</span>. Finally, he showed that reliable communication of the
                    information from the source in
                    the face of noise is possible if and only if <span class="formular">H &lt C </span>While this is a
                    theory of communication, it
                    is, at the same time, a theory of how information is produced and transferred — an information
                    theory. Thus Shannon is now considered
                    “the father of information theory.” </p>

                    Shannon's theory drew some conclusions, which directly led to the development of the whole
                    communication field. The 5G technology we use today is the two sets of coding methods proposed by
                    people after continuous exploration, which can get fast communication at the same time of given
                    reliability, so as to reach the theoretical speed limit.

                    Shannon is a scientist, whose theory is as fundamental as the laws of physics; Shannon is also a
                    mathematician, who has created new mathematical concepts to explain communication principles, and
                    these ideas have been widely used in other branches of mathematics; Shannon is even an engineer,
                    whose theory is inspired by practical engineering problems, and this theory has become the basic
                    framework of modern communication systems.
